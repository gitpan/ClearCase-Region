			ClearCase::Region Version 1.00

Copyright (c) 2003 Les Paul.
All rights reserved.
This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify it
under the same terms as Perl itself. 

The documentation for this extension can be found in the docs directory.
Please read this documentation to understand how to make these extensions
work in your environment.

The Log::Log4perl module must be installed to used these extensions.

To configure this module, cd to the directory that contains this README file
and type the following:

	perl Makefile.PL

Alternatively, if you plan to install ClearCase::region somewhere other than
your system's perl library directory. You can type something like this:

	perl Makefile.PL PREFIX=/home/me INSTALLDIRS=perl

Then to build you run make.

	make

You can then test the module by typing:

	make test

If you have write access to the installation directories, you may then
install by typing:

	make install

There are some sample programs in the examples directory.
This directory contains the Region.cfg and Vob.cfg sample files that must
be customized for your ClearCase environment (see docs).
The Region.cfg and Vob.cfg files should be installed in one of the @INC
directories.
Assuming your current directory is examples, you can test your install
by executing:

    perl -I. Region_test

or

	perl -I. Vob_test

The scripts in the examples directory use Log4perl configuration files that
get installed along with the modules.  These configuration files are
co_backup.conf, main_cos.conf, Region_test.conf and Vob_test.conf.  These
*.conf files will create a log named 'test.log' in the current directory
whenever the corresponding script is executed.
